inorder to use bootstrap we need two packages react-bootstrap and bootstrap but we include file form bootswatch then we just need to install react-bootstrap rather than both
https://react-bootstrap.github.io/layout/grid/
https://bootswatch.com/

react-bootstrap
yarn add react-router-dom react-router-bootstrap
in this application we are going to use BrowserRouter which uses html5 history api but you can you hash router that uses hash portion of url
